Restarted Flexbox tutorial
Changed div  div to nav div. moved title outside of nav div.
Restructured heading section divs for coherence and better design.
Gave each tag it's own div to make flexbox easier. started on the second part of the heading section. Look up font size in css.

Added styles and better indentified divs

CSS has more colors defined for all sections. Flexbox isn't working.
