Spent all day trying to get flexbox working.
really failing at this.

Figured out the font size. It's "font-size".
Messing around with flex-box again. This time trying to get text and picture to line up side by side.
h1, h2, and button I want on the right and picture on the left aligned evenly. 
Right now I'm thinking flexing them in columns then have the picture the same size as all the text but aligned evenly with them.
Next task understand flex-basis, flex-shrink, and flex-grow. I'm thinking of using a percentage for each item. Like image gets 50% button, h1, and h2 get 16.3%. then picture is aligned-right.

Restarted Flexbox tutorial
Changed div  div to nav div. moved title outside of nav div.
Restructured heading section divs for coherence and better design.
Gave each tag it's own div to make flexbox easier. started on the second part of the heading section. Look up font size in css.

Added styles and better indentified divs

CSS has more colors defined for all sections. Flexbox isn't working.

Flexbox needs more divs to arrange properly. Added Readme.
